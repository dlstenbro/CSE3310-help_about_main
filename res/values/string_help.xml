        Motion detect - Motion is detected at the time in which an object in your environment shifts. This is displayed on the screen as different pixels.
                        Simply, keep the camera steady at target(s), and allow the camera to view the surrounding area.\n

        \nColor Detect - When color detection is enabled, keep camera steady on the object. The camera will detect the color and view the color on screen.\n

        \nCounter - Keep camera steady and allow the camera to see the objects. The line in the center will increase the counter on the top right when an object moves/crosses over the counter line.\n
